- Feature-driven folder structure inspired by [Bulletproof React](https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react)
- ESLint for static code checks
- Prettier for consistent code formatting
- TypeScript for type checking
- Husky & lint-staged for pre-commit hooks
- Cypress for integration testing
- Jest for unit testing
- Storybook for component documentation
- react-query for data fetching
- SCSS modules for styling
- GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration

## Features folder
- issues
- layout
- projects
	- API
	- components
	- index.ts `Barrel File`
- ui (reusable components)

- Barrel Files - define what a feature should export to the rest of the application
	- can be enforced by `EsLint`


## Typical Development Team
- one product manager
	- plans the features of the app
- one designer
	- prepare the look and feel of the UI (user interface)
- multiple developers
	- duties involve writing, testing, and reviewing code
	- larger teams may have QA (quality assurance) or test engineers

## My Team
- Jack - Product Manager
- Tara - Senior Developer
	- Tara approves your code changes (Git workflow)
	- Tara can be accessed through discord messaging
- Deniz - UI/UX Designer
